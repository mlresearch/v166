title: The Ability of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Audio Representations
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved unprecedented
  success in speech representation learning, but some questions regarding their representation
  ability remain unanswered. This paper addresses two of them: (1) Can SSL speech
  models deal with non-speech audio?; (2) Would different SSL speech models have insights
  into diverse aspects of audio features? To answer the two questions, we propose
  an ensemble framework to fuse SSL speech models’ embeddings and conduct extensive
  experiments on both speech and non-speech audio datasets. Ablation studies are carried
  out to evaluate the representation ability of each constituent model, its contribution
  to the whole framework, and different ensemble techniques such as feature averaging
  and concatenation. All experiments are conducted during NeurIPS 2021 HEAR Challenge
  as a standard evaluation pipeline provided by competition officials. Results show
  that (1) SSL speech models could extract meaningful features of a wide range of
  non-speech audio, while they may also fail on certain types of datasets; (2) different
  SSL speech models have insights into different aspects of audio features. Also,
  our framework generally surpasses state-of-the-art SSL speech/audio models and has
  superior performance on various datasets compared with other teams in HEAR Challenge.
