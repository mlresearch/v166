title: The Efficacy of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Audio Representations
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, which can serve as powerful
  upstream models to extract meaningful speech representations, have achieved
  unprecedented success in speech representation learning.  However, their
  effectiveness on non-speech datasets is relatively less explored. In this
  work, we propose an ensemble framework, with a combination of ensemble
  techniques, to fuse SSL speech models' embeddings. Extensive experiments on
  speech and non-speech audio datasets are conducted to investigate the
  representation abilities of our ensemble method and its single constituent
  model. Ablation studies are carried out to evaluate the performances of
  different ensemble techniques, such as feature averaging and concatenation.
  All experiments are conducted during NeurIPS 2021 HEAR Challenge as a
  standard evaluation pipeline provided by competition officials. Results
  demonstrate SSL speech models' strong abilities on various non-speech tasks,
  while we also note that they fail to deal with fine-grained music tasks, such
  as pitch classification and note onset detection. In addition, feature
  ensemble is shown to have great potential on producing more holistic
  representations, as our proposed framework generally surpasses
  state-of-the-art SSL speech/audio models and has superior performance on
  various datasets compared with other teams in HEAR Challenge. Our code is
