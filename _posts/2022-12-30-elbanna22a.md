title: 'BYOL-S: Learning Self-supervised Speech Representations by Bootstrapping'
abstract: Methods for extracting audio and speech features have been studied since
  pioneering work on spectrum analysis decades ago. Recent efforts are guided by the
  ambition to develop general-purpose audio representations. For example, deep neural
  networks can extract optimal embeddings if they are trained on large audio datasets.
  This work extends existing methods based on self-supervised learning by bootstrapping,
  proposes various encoder architectures, and explores the effects of using different
  pre-training datasets. Lastly, we present a novel training framework to come up
  with a <em>hybrid</em> audio representation, which combines handcrafted and data-driven
  learned audio features. All the proposed representations were evaluated within the
  HEAR NeurIPS 2021 challenge for auditory scene classification and timestamp detection
  tasks. Our results indicate that the hybrid model with a convolutional transformer
  as the encoder yields superior performance in most HEAR challenge tasks.
