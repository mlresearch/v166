title: 'From HEAR to GEAR: Generative Evaluation of Audio Representations'
abstract: 'The “Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations” (HEAR) is an emerging
  research program towards statistical models that can transfer to diverse machine
  listening tasks. The originality of HEAR is to conduct a fair,  “apples-to-apples”
  comparison of many deep learning models over many datasets, resulting in multitask
  evaluation metrics that are readily interpretable by practitioners. On the flip
  side, this comparison incurs a neural architecture search: as such, it is not directly
  interpretable in terms of audio signal processing. In this paper, we propose a complementary
  viewpoint on the HEAR benchmark, which we name GEAR: Generative Evaluation of Audio
  Representations. The key idea behind GEAR is to generate a dataset of sounds with
  few independent factors of variability, analyze it with HEAR embeddings, and visualize
  it with an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm. Visual inspection reveals stark
  contrasts in the global structure of the nearest-neighbor graphs associated to logmelspec,
  Open-$L^3$, BYOL, CREPE, wav2vec2, GURA, and YAMNet. Although GEAR currently lacks
  mathematical refinement, we intend it as a proof of concept to show the potential
  of parametric audio synthesis in general-purpose machine listening research.'
